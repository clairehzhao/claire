## Unit 2... Binary/Data Terms
- bits: The smallest unit of data that a computer can process and store. A bit is always in one of two physical states, similar to an on/off light switch. The state is represented by a single binary value, usually a 0 or 1.

- bytes: A byte is a unit of data that is eight binary digits long. A byte is the unit most computers use to represent a character such as a letter, number or typographic symbol. 00000000 - 11111111

- hexadecimal / nibbles: Hexadecimal is a numbering system with base 16. It can be used to represent large numbers with fewer digits. In this system there are 16 symbols or possible digit values from 0 to 9, followed by six alphabetic characters -- A, B, C, D, E and F. It can be used for colors, ex. #FCD0E0

- boolean: true or false value

- ASCII: most common character encoding format for text data in computers and on the internet

- Unicode: the universal character representation standard for text in computer processing.

- RGB: (red, green, and blue) refers to a system for representing the colors to be used on a computer display.

- Lossy: Lossy is a data encoding and compression technique that deliberately discards some data in the compression process

- Lossless: restores and rebuilds file data in its original form after the file is decompressed

## Unit 3... Algorithm/Programming Terms
- variable: used to store information to be used and referred to

- data types: integer, strings, boolean, lists, dictionaries

- lists: abstract data type that represents a finite number of ordered values

- dictionaries: an abstract data type that defines an unordered collection of data as a set of key-value pairs

![lists/dict](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/806618712056528906/1052996070076067981/IMG_8058.jpg)

- assignment operators:
    - addition: a + b
    - subtraction: a - b
    - multiplication: a * b
    - division: a / b
    - MOD: a % b

- algorithm: commands that do a certain task

- sequence: the order in which the statements are executed

- selection: a section of code is run only if a condition is met.

- iteration: a repeating portion of an algorithm, repeats a specified number of times or until a given condition is met

- characters: a display unit of information equivalent to one alphabetic letter or symbol

- expressions: combination of operators/operands

truth tables

- AND: 1 1
- OR: 0 1, 1 0, 1 1
- XOR: 0 0, 1 1
- NOT: 0

- length: number of characters in a string

- concatenation: combining two things

- upper/Lower: change case

- traversing Strings: use index

- if: do an action when something is true

- elif: first condition false, test another

- else: action when first condition false

- nested selection: condition inside condition

![if](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/806618712056528906/1053001319880863824/IMG_3764.jpg)

- for: action for each x in y

- while: loops as long as condition true
 
- break: end loop

- continue: keep loop

![forloop](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/806618712056528906/1053002524828901416/IMG_2430.jpg)

- def: defining a function to do a procedure

- parameters: values given to a function to work with

- return: brings variables out of function after running
