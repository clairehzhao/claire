<p>I started off the night getting locked into the sound booth…
BUT a teacher was able to get me out right in time to present my project</p>

<h2 id="presenting">
<a class="anchor" href="#presenting" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Presenting</h2>
<ul>
  <li>presented to multiple groups
    <ul>
      <li>Mr. Mortenson</li>
      <li>parents</li>
      <li>kids</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="other-groups">
<a class="anchor" href="#other-groups" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Other Groups</h2>
<p>I tried to walk around in the APCSA room to learn from them
Here are some of the things that I observed:</p>
<ul>
  <li>all of the projects were very personal and usable</li>
  <li>projects had functions that were good for day-to-day use</li>
  <li>they implemented other subjects like math and science into their project</li>
</ul>

Project that implemented math tools for calculus!</p>

2048 game that they coded with different colors! This game was not only interactive, but it was also a game that many people recognize. We were able to use the website on our own and we didn’t need explanation to use the website which is cool.</p>

<a class="anchor" href="#improvement-and-overall-experience" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Improvement and Overall Experience</h2>
<ul>
  <li>It was really cool and nice to present the project that I have been working on for weeks</li>
  <li>We could have implemented a way for the user to search up songs</li>
  <li>We were not able to connect the backend and the frontend, so being able to get that connected</li>
  <li>I am excited to see how next trimester project will improve</li>
</ul>
