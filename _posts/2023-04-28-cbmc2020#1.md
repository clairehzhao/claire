## Corrections:

### Question 18

This question is incorrect because the option D allows for the robot to return back to its original place because it will rotate right two times instead of just once.

### Question 22

This question is incorrect because in the code segment that I chose it leaves a 6/8 chance of lose a turn which is not the one that is filling up most of the spinner.

### Question 35

This question is incorrect because the option that I chose is not a generalization of the procedure rather another similar procedure. Option B allows for a generalization of the procedure by choosing the max out of a number list.

### Question 58

This question is incorrect because it allows for the procedure to return the value of false which is still correct. The answer of C is correct because it returns false even though two of the inputs are equal in value making it not run as intended.

## Reflection:

I found that this week I did much better on the practice quiz and did not use any outside resources while taking the practice quiz. Most of the questions I am getting wrong are similar to previous incorrect questions so I just need to review those more, overall I feel that I am getting much better at these college board quizzes.
