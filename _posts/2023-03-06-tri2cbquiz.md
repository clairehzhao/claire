## Multiple Choice Review

### Question 22

The correct answer is A "Grid 1 Only". Grid 1 successfully brings the robot to the grey square, but grid 2 is not able to do that. In grid 2 the robot is able to successfully go through until it reaches the last turn. Instead of going left to the grey square it will go right and that is not where the grey square is located. 


### Question 31

The correct answer should be D in this problem "Check if the time is during business hours. If it is, check if the gate sensor is activated. If it is, check if the gate is open. If it is not, turn on the motor." During this question I missread the answers and accidentally clicked B instead. It should be D where they turn on the motor if the gate is not activated.


### Question 39

The correct answer to this question should be A "Inserting the statement count  ‚Üê
count + 1 between line 6 and line 7". This is the correct answer because the counting is inside of the repeat which means that you only need to add one every time because the addition of 1 is added twice already from the repeat. If it was B then there would be an addition of 4 to the count.


### Question 41

The correct answer to this question should be B "The list must be sorted based on the genetic code values." This is the correct answer because binary search can only work if the values are sorted and in this case they are sorting the values based off of genetic code values. A is not the right answer because it does not matter if the numbers are decimal or binary as long as they are sorted.


### Question 46

The correct answer to this question is C "A procedure that returns the sum of the values in the file". Instead of adding one value to the other we need to add all of the values in that are given to find the average.


## Reflection

I was able to answer most of the questions accurately. There were some questions that were harder for me like the ones about functions of code. I found that being able to work with my teammates helped because we were able to catch each others mistakes and help each other. I also find that as I do more of these quizzes I start to see patterns and realize what I need to study more while also learning more.
