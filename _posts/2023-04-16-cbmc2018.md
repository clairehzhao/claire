## Corrections:

### Question 10

![10](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/806618712056528906/1097630269596508270/IMG_2527.jpg)

I got this question wrong because I missread the code that was given as the answers. I need to read the questions clearly and make sure I am understanding the code as well.


### Question 14

I got this question wrong because I did not realize that the two functions would display the same number of values. This is apparent because it is the same program just with the display in two different parts of the program


### Question 39

I got this question incorrect because I did not know what the definitions of open standards and protocols is. The definition is "Open standard protocols for identity federation define how service providers (SPs) and identity providers (IdPs) exchange identity information. Open standards are critical to enable secure interoperability between unique identity systems, web resources, organizations and vendors." The answer to this question would be A because they allow for systems to communicate even with different networks.


### Question 40

I got this question wrong because I thought that number three would be too complicated to find with the data given. You are able to find the proportion of students who improved their total points as a result of the score replacement policy because we are able to compare the values of the different students.


### Question 43

![43](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/806618712056528906/1097762890565566514/IMG_2927.jpg)

I got this question wrong because I thought that squaring a large number would result in a large number of steps and that is not a reasonable amount of time. Instead the number is reasonable because the number is n^2 and that is a polynomial.


### Question 46

![46](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/806618712056528906/1097762901189734480/IMG_4022.jpg)

I got this question wrong because I thought that the algorithm can be made it just won't have an answer. Instead problems that don't have answers are not able to create an algorithm.


### Question 54

![54](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/806618712056528906/1097763916886577212/IMG_5479.jpg)

I got this question incorrect because I did not realize that this was supposed to be a generalization of the procedure. To generalize this procedure it has to be the power and the variable


### Question 58

![58](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/806618712056528906/1097762914502447114/IMG_6386.jpg)

I got this question wrong because for this answer, III, it is incorrect because some problems can not be solved with large input sizes.


### Question 60

![60](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/806618712056528906/1097762924472307713/IMG_3277.jpg)

Being able to create a list of the names will allow for better procedural abstraction. The definition of procedural abstraction is code that can be applicable to a variety of different situations.


### Question 63

![63](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/806618712056528906/1097762932894470195/IMG_0271.jpg)

Count should only be counted if the prime value is true which means line 9 should be deleted.


## Reflection

A lot of the questions that I got wrong were because I did not pay attention to the question or to the answer which is really important. I also found that as I took the test and got more tired, I started to do worse and that is something I need to keep in mind. With the content there are just some definitions I need to remember and solidify my understanding of them.
