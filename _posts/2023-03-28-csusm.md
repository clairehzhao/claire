## Introduction

Ashley:
- worked in a research lab at Csusm
- first generation student
- good support system and smaller campus
- failures do not define you
- CS degrees are versatile and can be applied to many different fields

John:
- from escondido
- started at palomar community college for 3 years
- degree in computer science
- took him a little longer to get bachelors degree (6 years)
- CS degrees are versatile and can be applied to many different fields

## Pathways
- chemistry
- biochemistry
- applied physics
- computer engineering
- computer science
- biological science
- mathematics
- biotechnology
- electrical engineering

## Experiences
- hackathons
- reach out to professors
- different clubs
    - robotics
    - women in STEM
    - society of women engineers
- lots of different classes

## Internships
- period of work
- offered by any organization for a limited period of time (4 weeks to 2 years)
- how to get an internship
    - check emails
    - campus events
    - join clubs
    - networking
    - google!!
- tips:
    - try to avoid unpaid opportunities
        - you deserve more!
    - apply even if you're underqualified
    - ask faculty members for help

## Programs

There are many different programs that help with discovering your interest. Great for exploring different programs as well. 

- summer scholars program
    - paid
- quantum bridge program
    - paid

## Research

Oportunities to study different topics

- cancer cell research
- quantum science research
- meteorite research
- microplastic research

## Paying for college
- scholarship and grant
    - grant is from government
    - scholarship is from the school
    - scholarships are all over the place and can be given in so many different situations
- loans
    - pay back loans 6 months after you graduate
    - there are options for those who are facing financial hardship

## Life after CSUSM
- some will go straight to teaching credential programs
- should get paid when getting PHD

## Reflection

This panel was really interesting for me because they discussed college on general terms but also engineering specific. I really liked how Ashley talked about how failure does not define you and that failure is a normal thing. I enjoyed seeing all of the different opportunities that CSUSM offered to their students and how much information she was able to provide. I also find it cool how most of the speakers we have heard from in the past all talk about how we need to have computer science and engineering skills in almost all professions. This panel was able to give me a lot of new information and insight on how college can be and what we can expect during college.
