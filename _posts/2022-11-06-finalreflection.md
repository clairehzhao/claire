- answer A is incorrect because this was only the result of x after the code is executed, but its not the actual result's value
- answer C is the correct answer. The result of this function is the sum of the integers from 0 to 5, which is 15

### Question 48 (4.B)
Which variables are equal to 50 after assignments

- answer D is incorrect because the value of y changes from being 50 to 75
- answer C is correct because x gets assigned to 50 in the 4th line and z get assigned 50 in the last line

## Overall Reflection
I scored pretty well on this quiz and only missed two questions. Both of these questions are in section 4.B which means that this section is what I have the least knowledge in. To improve on this, this weekend I plan on watching daily video 1 and 2, for section 3.1. This will help me improve on this portion of the quiz.
