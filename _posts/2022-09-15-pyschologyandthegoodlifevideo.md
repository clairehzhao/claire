# Video Notes
- yale university professor
- yale students are filled with lots of stress
- little times at yale to do the little things that bring them joy
- this is not just at yale, this is at college campuses all around the country
- 40% percent of college students present more than the average level of stress
- 1/3 of students are so depressed it is difficult the function
- over 40% are hopeless
- just under 50% of students are feeling an overwhelming amount of anxiety
- over 80% of the students are feeling overwhelmed by all the things they are supposed to be doing all the time
- need a better culture and enviromnment in school
- not just being realized in the colleges
- 1 out of every 4 students took this class in yale
- showing that there was a need for this class
- in class they learned
    - you are not stuck in the well-being that you are in right now
    - many people realize that bad things that happen in their life cause them to become happier, they learn to live life fully now that something horrible has happened to them
    - it takes a lot of effort and permanent changes to become happier
    - G.I. Joe fallacy that knowing is just half the battle, we have to put in the effort and work
    - recognizing that your mind is lying to you about what it means to be happy
    - people think that money/salary will make you happier
    - those who think that money is needed to be happy, tend to be the ones with worse well-being
- things that people can do to be happier:
    - prioritize time for social connection
    - human connection causes more positivity
    - helping others: spending any amount of money on others
    - make time for gratitude every single day: private and public
