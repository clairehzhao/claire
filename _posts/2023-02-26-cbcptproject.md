Program Purpose

3.a.i

The purpose of the program is to identify the users next ovulation date to inform them of the next time they will be most ovulated.

3.a.ii

The function of this program is that the user will be asked to insert their next period day, period length, and menstrual cycle length. Once the user tracks their data they will get their next ovulation date as well as have their next period day, period length, and menstrual cycle length saved in the database. The table will print all the values that they have now as well as what they inputted previously.

3.a.iii

The input of the program are the dates of their last period, their usual period length, and their usual menstrual cycle length. Their output would show the next date that they will be ovulated (a 6 day period). The table will also output the data that they input (next period day, period length, and menstrual cycle length) because it was added to the database.

The list that is being used in this case is users. 

Managing Complexity

3.b.iv

The data in this list is the data that each of the users have for their next period day, period length, and menstrual cycle length.

3.b.v

This manages complexity in the program because being able to have all of the users in one list means that there does not have to be an individual function to read for each of the users. This allows for the code to be shortened to go through each value for each individual user. Without this code there then each user would have to have their own function and it would be harder for the database to add new users because each new user would need to create a new segment of code.

There are three procedures being shown in this program. There is create, read, and delete. First the
