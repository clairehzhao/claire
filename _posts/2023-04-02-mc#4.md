## Reflection

I was able to get 50/50 on this quiz. I found that this quiz had a lot of new topics but they were less code based and were more reading based. I think I need to work on converting different numbers into binary and also understanding some of the code segments. I think that I can definitely study unit 5 a little more to help study for the AP exam. I overall think that this quiz was easier.
