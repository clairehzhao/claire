### Question 2

On this question I misclicked, I need to read the question and answer fully to make sure that I am answering the questions correctly.

### Question 20

On this question C is incorrect because it will evaluate to true for restaurants with a correct customer rating and will evaluate to false for restaurants with an incorrect customer rating, regardless of the price range

## Reflection

Overall I feel that the more I work on these college board multiple choice questions the more I am improving. These questions are all pretty similar in each topic and it gives me a good feel and understanding to how the MC will be on the actual AP exam. This practice is also helpful to make sure that I am understanding all of the Big Ideas that we are learning in class.
