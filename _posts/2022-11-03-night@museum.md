## Getting locked into the sound booth

I started off the night getting locked into the sound booth...
BUT a teacher was able to get me out right in time to present my project

## Presenting
- presented to multiple groups
    - Mr. Mortenson
    - parents
    - kids

## Other Groups
I tried to walk around in the APCSA room to learn from them
Here are some of the things that I observed:
- all of the projects were very personal and usable
- projects had functions that were good for day-to-day use
- they implemented other subjects like math and science into their project

Project that implemented math tools for calculus!

2048 game that they coded with different colors! This game was not only interactive, but it was also a game that many people recognize. We were able to use the website on our own and we didn't need explanation to use the website which is cool.

## Improvement and Overall Experience
- It was really cool and nice to present the project that I have been working on for weeks
- We could have implemented a way for the user to search up songs 
- We were not able to connect the backend and the frontend, so being able to get that connected 
- I am excited to see how next trimester project will improve
