I started off the night getting locked into the sound booth...
BUT a teacher was able to get me out right in time to present my project

## Presenting
- presented to multiple groups
    - Mr. Mortenson
    - parents
    - kids

## Other Groups
I tried to walk around in the APCSA room to learn from them
Here are some of the things that I observed:
- all of the projects were very personal and usable
- projects had functions that were good for day-to-day use
- they implemented other subjects like math and science into their project
