I got a 45/50, missing question 13, 15, 30, 33, and 47.</p>

<h3 id="question-13">
<a class="anchor" href="#question-13" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Question 13</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/806618712056528906/1067333043490136134/IMG_0889.jpg" alt="13">
The correct answer was D, II and III only, because they have the NOT symbol in front. The person can not be both less than/greater than 18 and 16 so one of them must have the NOT symbol.</p>

<h3 id="question-15">
<a class="anchor" href="#question-15" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Question 15</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/806618712056528906/1067334418605289482/IMG_1729.jpg" alt="15">
The correct answer was D. This is because on the last move at the top of the map it has to option to either go right or left. If it was accurately following the code then it would choose to rotate to the right before left. In D it chose to go left which is wrong.</p>

<h3 id="question-30">
<a class="anchor" href="#question-30" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Question 30</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/806618712056528906/1067337096286711858/IMG_9168.jpg" alt="30">
The correct answer would be B and C. The drawCircle would be after assigning the new variables because they are needed to draw the circles correctly. Without these variables the circles can not be drawn.</p>

<h3 id="question-33">
<a class="anchor" href="#question-33" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Question 33</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/806618712056528906/1067338020728090684/IMG_9007.jpg" alt="33">
The correct answer would be C because for algorithm II they are able to always ensure that the max is found. Algorithm I only works if it is greater than or equal to -1 because they set the current max as -1 so it needs to be greater than that to be the new max.</p>

<h3 id="question-47">
<a class="anchor" href="#question-47" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Question 47</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/806618712056528906/1067339106314633236/IMG_3395.jpg" alt="47">
The correct answer would be C because this is a problem that needs a lot of time to solve so being able to use heurstics will be able to help. B does not need it because it is based off of math and that can be finished in a reasonable time.</p>
