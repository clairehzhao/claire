    <p>Answer with an opinion and learnings so far this year:  What are pros/cons on internet blockers at router and lack of admin password on lab machines at school?
Having internet blockers at our school have their pros and cons. The school is able to ensure that the students are visiting appropriate and safe websites. A negative thing about this feature is that students sometimes need to use certain websites that are blocked and must use a VPN or hotspot. The benefits of students being able to use lab machines freely is that they have more access to the resources that they need, while also having more freedom. A disadvantage is that students could end up using the lab machines innappropriately.</p>

  <li>What concerns do you have personally about the digital divide?  For yourself or for others.
A concern that I have about the digital divide for others is that they could start to fall behind in technology and will not have as many resources as us. A concern that I have for myself when it comes to digital divide is that I could not have as much access to resources as others.</li>
