    "- A procedure is a named set of instructions that can take in parameters and return values.\n",
    "    - May be called \"method\" or \"function\" in different programming languages.\n",
    "- Parameters are independent variables used in the procedure to produce a result. It allows a procedure to execute without initially knowing specific input values.\n",
    "- To call a procedure you would write the name of the procedure followed by the parentheses with the parameters of the procedure\n",
    "- Procedures do not require parameters, but the parentheses must be there\n",
    "- To use return values, you have to write the syntax return followed by the expression you would like to return var\n",
    "- Modularity - the practice of breaking a complex program into smaller, independent parts or modules that can be used and reused in different parts of the program\n",
    "- Abstraction - the practice of hiding the details of how a particular code or system works and exposing only the essential features or functions that are necessary for other parts of the program to use\n",
    "- Duplication - having multiple duplicate code blocks, often decreasing readability and efficiency\n",
    "- Logic - the sequence of steps and operations that a computer follows to execute a program, including the specific instructions and decision-making processes built into the code\n",
    "- Arguments - a way to provide information to a function, usually defined outside a function and then imported into a function with parameters"
