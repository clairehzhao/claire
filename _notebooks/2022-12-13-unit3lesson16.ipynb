    "- What is a simulation?\n",
    "    - A simulation is an imitation of a situation or process\n",
    "    - Aka a virtual experiment\n",
    "- Experiment definition: procedure undertaken to make a discovery, test a hypothesis, or demonstrate a known fact\n",
    "- So, why use a simulation?\n",
    "    - Advantages:\n",
    "        - Can be safer\n",
    "        - More cost-effective\n",
    "        - More efficient\n",
    "        - More data in less time\n",
    "    - Disadvantages:\n",
    "        - Not as accurate as experiments\n",
    "        - Outside factors not included (ex: in rolling dice simulation gravity and air resistance)\n",
    "    - When do you not use a simulation?\n",
    "        - When a situation already has set results/data (won't change)\n",
    "        - Examples: a score in a game, most purchased food, average yearly wage\n"

This can be used to simulate the crash of the plane and then simulating what people would do for an emergency evacuation.
