<p>My group and I were able to present our project to multiple individuals around the room. Some of these included students, parents, younger kids, Mr. Mortensen, and Mr. Yeung. It was really interesting to see how different people responded to our project and how we were able to teach and inform parents about the topic. I really liked how a lot of parents gave us feedback on how we could make our website more feasible and what they would add to the project. Some of the feedback that we got on our project was that the overall look of our website was eye-chatching and professional. One thing that we could have tried implementing was not making all of the data public to everyone which I thought was a good point that they brought up.</p>

<p>After we presented our project I went around the APCSA and APCSP room to see the other projects that were being shown. One project that caught my eye was one of the APCSA projects called “Snapshot”</p>

<p>This project was interesting because it had a successful login page that allowed for each individual to have their own database. It was also really cool how they catered this specific website to those who are in photography classes. In this project they are able to upload images into a image gallery and keep track of all of the photos that they took.</p>

<p>After looking through the CS classrooms I went around the school to see other classes like photography and ceramics. One of the ceraics projects that I found really cute was the gnomes that many people had. Here is one that was especially cute:</p>

<p>There were many beautiful photography photos that were being shown in the photography classroom. The ones that were involving nature stood out to me because of how beautiful they were and how amazing the nature around us really is.</p>

<p>My overall thoughts on this trimesters N@TM is that I was really happy with the progress that I made this trimester compared to last trimester. I feel that this trimester I was able to go into N@TM with a better understanding of what was going on in the project that I was presenting and felt that the project was an improvement because of the successful implication of backend. This trimester I also feel that now that I have a better feel of this class in general which is helping a lot. I am happy with the outcome of N@TM and feel that we were able to showcase what we learned over the trimester. It is always so interesting and fun to see what other people accomplished over the trimester and this is a great time to be able to see others work as well.</p>
